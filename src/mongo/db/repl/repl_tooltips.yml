rs member _id {1} state: |
    Description: Replica set state: 0:STARTUP (serving still starting up, or still trying to initiate the set), 1:PRIMARY, 2:SECONDARY, 3:RECOVERING (recovering/resyncing; after recovery usually auto-transitions to secondary), 5:STARTUP2 (initial sync), 6:UNKNOWN (remote node not yet reached), 7:ARBITER, 8:DOWN (node not reachable for a report), 9:ROLLBACK, 10:REMOVED (node removed from replica set). This indicates what state this node thinks node with id \<node\_id\> is in.
    Things the metric can indicate: What state this node thinks it and other nodes in the set are in.
    Reported from: [replSetGetStatus](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/replSetGetStatus) command, which uses this node's own data as well as data included in heartbeats sent to the server by other members of the replica set. Because of the frequency of heartbeats, the other member data could be several seconds out of date.

    Description: For self: the number of seconds the member has been online. For other nodes: Time since first successful heartbeat response from other node to self, if currently still up. Note that sometimes the uptime for other nodes can fall to zero, but this may be from situations like a network partition and does not necessarily indicate a full restart.

rs member _id {1} ping time: |
    Description: The number of milliseconds (ms) that a round-trip replication heartbeat takes to travel between  \<node\_id\> and this node. Processing a replication heartbeat requires the receiving node to take the global replication mutex. As a result, a high "heartbeat time" to a node can indicate mutex contention on that node. This is from the pingMs value in the replSetGetStatus output, and not the result of a "ping" command.
    Things this could indicate:  High ping time can be an indication of many things like network issues, cpu bottleneck, or replication coordinator mutex contention (because heartbeats [acquire the replication coordinator mutex](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/replication_coordinator_impl.cpp#L6332-L6338).)  In the absence of evidence of the first two, you can likely conclude on mutex contention. Other metrics that could indicate replication coordinator mutex contention are [ss wt log log flush operations](#ss-wt-log-log-flush-operations) , [ftdc serverStatus metrics repl waiters replication](#ftdc-serverstatus-metrics-repl-waiters-replication), [ss metrics repl network getmores num](#ss-metrics-repl-network-getmores-num)

The lastCommittedWallTime  is, from the viewpoint of this node, the time of the most recent operation that has either: been written to the oplog on a majority of replica set members (v8.0+), or been written to the oplog and applied on a majority of replica set members (prior to v8.0). On the primary, [lastCommitted is updated by checking the member data of the replica set members](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/topology_coordinator.cpp#L2961-L3002). Secondaries receive the lastCommited opTime from the primary through [heartbeats](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/replication_coordinator_impl_heartbeat.cpp#L323) and [through](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/data_replicator_external_state_impl.cpp#L103) receiving [oplog batches](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/oplog_fetcher.cpp#L961). This means that on a secondary this metric may be negative, as lastCommitted may be ahead of this secondary's lastApplied.

    Things this could indicate: If there is replication lag, and both this metric and [ss metrics repl buffer sizeBytes](#ss-metrics-repl-buffer-sizebytes) are low on the secondary, while the primary's workload doesn't change, this could indicate replication coordinator mutex contention on the primary, since when the primary prepares oplog metadata to respond to an oplog getmore, it has to [take the mutex](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/replication_coordinator_impl.cpp#L6278). Other metrics that could indicate replication coordinator mutex contention are [heartbeat time](#rs-member-_id-\<node_id\>-ping-time-/-heartbeat-time:), [ss wt log log flush operations](#ss-wt-log-log-flush-operations) , [ftdc serverStatus metrics repl waiters replication](#ftdc-serverstatus-metrics-repl-waiters-replication),

    Description: The difference between the [lastAppliedOpTime on this node and the oplog visibility timestamp](https://github.com/10gen/t2/blob/master/front/descriptors.ts#L1606-L1614). This can indicate "oplog holes" \- oplog entries representing operations yet to be completed on the primary. Beware that [a lag of 0 does not necessarily mean there is no hole](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/STAR-4558) \- See [ftdc serverStatus wiredTiger oplog visibility timestamp t rate](#ftdc-serverstatus-wiredtiger-oplog-visibility-timestamp-t-rate) and [ftdc serverStatus wiredTiger oplog visibility timestamp i rate](#ftdc-serverstatus-wiredtiger-oplog-visibility-timestamp-i-rate) to see if the oplog visibility is moving forward or not. If the visibility is moving forward, that means there isn't a long-standing oplog hole. For example, if the “t rate” above is always moving at 1/s, this means that every second the oplog visibility has moved forward; meaning that there isn't a multi-second oplog hole.

ss network bytesOut: |
    Description: The number of bytes (compressed by snappy/zlib/zstd before) sending out over the network
    Things this can indicate: For a specific socket-socket pair (such as between a primary and a secondary), this can be used in combination with the other node's [ss network bytesIn / ss network snappy/zlib/zstd decompressor bytesIn](#ss-network-bytesin-/-ss-network-\(snappy/zlib/zstd-decompressor\)-bytesin) to see if how much time occurs between bytes going out over the network on one node and bytes coming in on the other node. If there is a large amount of time between the two, this might indicate that messages are taking a long time to be sent over the network.

ss network bytesIn: |
    Description: The number of bytes (decompressed by snappy/zlib/zstd) after receiving over the network
    Things this can indicate: For a specific socket-socket pair (such as between a primary and a secondary), this can be used in combination with the other node's [ss network snappy/zlib/zstd compressor bytesOut](#ss-network-bytesout-/-ss-network-\(snappy/zlib/zstd-compressor\)-bytesout) to see if how much time occurs between bytes going out over the network on one node and bytes coming in on the other node.

ss wt log log flush operations: |
    Description: The number of times WiredTiger flushed the journal in the last second
    Things this can indicate: This should be at least 10/s because of the [normal interval for journal flushing](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/storage/storage_options.h#L93), so if it is below that, it indicates that journaling is not happening on its normal schedule. A couple possible explanations are disk issues, replication coordinator mutex contention (related to [updating lastDurable](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/replication_coordinator_external_state_impl.cpp#L1442) which [takes the replication coordinator mutex](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/replication_coordinator_impl.cpp#L1690)), or something else. Other metrics that could indicate replication coordinator mutex contention are [heartbeat time](#rs-member-_id-\<node_id\>-ping-time-/-heartbeat-time:), [ftdc serverStatus metrics repl waiters replication](#ftdc-serverstatus-metrics-repl-waiters-replication), [ss metrics repl network getmores num](#ss-metrics-repl-network-getmores-num)

ftdc serverStatus metrics repl waiters replication: |
    Description: The number of items in the [WriteConcernWaiterList](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/replication_coordinator_impl.h#L966). This is the waiter list of things waiting for write concern (i.e. operations that are waiting to be replicated to secondaries.
    Things this can indicate: If this increases significantly, this could indicate replication coordinator mutex contention, since adding/removing from the list and signaling waiters [requires taking the mutex](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/c41e87779e5dc89aa2f939d6a7b52aea1a650740/src/mongo/db/repl/replication_coordinator_impl.h#L936-L951).
